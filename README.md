# Pros:
-Supports all controllers (Dinput/Xinput, recommend using DS4Windows for Dinput controllers).

-Chinese Nvidia Shield TV "accurate" Profile.

-Relative Motion (control Stick/Dpad to move the cursor).

-Vibrations (Xinput Only, unless you installed DS4Windows for your Dinput controller).

# Cons:
-Wiimote's "A" button and Shield's "A" button conflict:

‎  -Wiimote uses "A" as "Enter" and "Star punch".
  
‎  -Shield uses "A" as "Enter" and "Left jab".
  
(This is the only "Con" because people may familiar with the "A" button as "Enter", so you'll need to rely on the "X" button for now).
