## Pros:
-Supports all controllers (Dinput/Xinput)

-Chinese Nvidia Shield TV "accurate" Profile

-Relative Motion (control Stick/Dpad to move the cursor)

-Vibrations (Xinput Only, unless you installed DS4Windows for your wireless controller. )

## Cons:
-Wiimote's "A" Button conflict (Uses "1" as bind instead of "3" because Nvidia uses "3" as both "A" and "1" buttons of the Wiimote)
